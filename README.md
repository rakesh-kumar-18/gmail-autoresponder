# Gmail Autoresponder

This project is a Gmail autoresponder script that checks for unread emails, responds to them with a predefined message, and applies a label to those emails. It utilizes the Gmail API to interact with your Gmail account and Node.js for scripting. The project is set up to run at regular intervals using `setInterval` for automation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rakesh-kumar-18/gmail-autoresponder.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gmail-autoresponder
   ```
   
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
4. Create a `credentials.json` file and add your Gmail API credentials. You can follow [Google's guide](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart) to obtain your credentials.

## Usage
To run the autoresponder script, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the script, which will check for unread emails at regular intervals and send an autoresponse to those emails. The script is set to run every 60 seconds by default (const interval = 60000;), but you can adjust this interval in the code if needed.

## Libraries and Technologies
This project utilizes the following libraries and technologies:

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Google APIs**: The Gmail API is used to interact with your Gmail account.
- **googleapis**: A Node.js library that provides easy access to various Google APIs.
- **google-auth-library**: A Node.js library for authenticating with Google services.
- **Buffer**: Used for encoding email content to base64.
  
## Improvements
While this project is functional, there are several areas where it can be improved:

1. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to provide more informative error messages and graceful failure recovery.
2. **Configuration Options**: Consider adding a configuration file for settings such as the autoresponder message, label name, and polling interval. This would make the script more flexible.
3. **Security**: Ensure the secure storage of API credentials and other sensitive information, especially in production environments.
4. **Testing**: Create unit tests to verify the correctness of the script and its behavior in different scenarios.
5. **User Interaction**: If this script is intended for broader use, you might consider developing a user interface or a command-line interface for user interaction.
6. **Dockerization**: Dockerize the application for easier deployment and scalability.
7. **Throttling and Rate Limiting**: Implement mechanisms to handle Gmail API rate limits and avoid excessive API requests.
